# Fishhcheat
So good, it got leaked ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

```loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parrot121761/Fishhcheat/refs/heads/main/loader.lua'))()```

## Overview
Fishhcheat is a free unobfuscated script for Typical Colors 2. Features include :
* Plain and silent aimbot
* Somewhat functional projectile aimbot
* Hitbox expander
* Customizable ESP
* Various player movement and weapon exploits
* Rage features like wallbang

## Executor
Fishhcheat was coded on Swift, however there is a stripped-down version compatible with Solara.

## Risk of ban
While this script is currently fully undetected by the anticheat, I can not guarantee it will remain this way forever.
Most bans in TC2 nowadays are manual ones enforced by moderators, so if you get rage hack often you risk getting reported.
Only exploit on accounts you won't regret losing.

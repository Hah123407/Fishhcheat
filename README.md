## Executor
* Any paid executor that properly supports hookmetamethod should work fine.
* Mobile executors work too.
* There is a downgraded version available for Solara.
* Executors that it don't seem to work on properly : Luna, Cryptic PC

## Risk of ban
* I would suggest using asger's anticheat bypass available on the discord server cuz their anticheat is annoying af (they just rename ban remotes constantly)
* Only exploit on accounts you don't care about losing
* Moderators can and probably will manual ban you anyways if you keep ragehacking
* TC2 has alt detection. you can find a way to bypass roblox alt detections on youtube

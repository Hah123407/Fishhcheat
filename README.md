## Executor
Fishhcheat was coded on Swift, however there is a stripped-down version compatible with Solara.

## Risk of ban
The current status is questionable. Some features get you banned. Use with caution
If you are constantly getting banned try forcing Solara version by typing the following before the loadstring :
```getgenv().Solara = true```
Some bans are manual ones enforced by moderators, so if you get rage hack often you risk getting reported.
Only exploit on accounts you won't regret losing.

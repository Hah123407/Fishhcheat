## Executor
Fishhcheat was coded on Swift, however there is a stripped-down version compatible with Solara.

## Risk of ban
While this script is currently fully undetected by the anticheat, I can not guarantee it will remain this way forever.
Most bans in TC2 nowadays are manual ones enforced by moderators, so if you get rage hack often you risk getting reported.
Only exploit on accounts you won't regret losing.
